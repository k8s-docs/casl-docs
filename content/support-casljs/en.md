CASL.js is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support CASL.js development via the following methods:

## One-time Donations

We accept donations through these channels:

## Why is it important for you?

If you run a business and are using CASL.js in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor CASL.js development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the JavaScript community and makes it easier to attract developers.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using CASL, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like [buying me coffee](https://opencollective.com/casljs/donate/details) once in a while :)
